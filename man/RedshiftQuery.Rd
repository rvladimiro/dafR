\title{Query data from a Redshift database}
\usage{
RedshiftQuery(query, dbID, s3ID, yamlConfig = "../db.yml",
  acceleration = TRUE, parallel = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Character vector with length 1. Can be either a SQL query or a path to a text file containing a SQL query}

\item{dbID}{The name of the yaml group containing the database credentials}

\item{s3ID}{The name of the yaml group containing the s3 bucket credentials}

\item{yamlConfig}{The path to the yaml file}

\item{acceleration}{Use s3 bucket acceleration}

\item{parallel}{Use parallel package for simultaneous connections to s3}
}
\value{
The function will return a data.table object with the results of the query. In the case of a timeout it will return a string with the path of the created files on the s3 bucket
}
\description{
This functions runs queries pn Redshift via the UNLOAD command.
The query is unloaded to an s3 bucket and then read locally.
It handles connecting, querying, reading from s3 and disconnecting. The query can either be passed directly as a string or as a path to a file containing a SQL statement.

The yaml file must contain host, dbname, s3 bucket name, user and password.

This function, as opposed to PostgreSQLQuery, is intended to run large queries that might return a large amount of data or take some time to complete.
